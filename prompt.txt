Grep all logs for exception,error,fail
GET HYPED WE'RE BUILDING FIRE
Once you have found errors precisely identify what you would have to change in the local repo to fix them - but do not change yet.

docker compose not docker-compose
dont edit stuff on the server just fix stuff in the local repo and i'll apply changes to the server!
dont fix anything just make me a comprehensive error report
this was freshly deployed from the latest repo just for you! NOTE WELL: this stack was deployed COMPLETELY FRESH after very AGGRESSIVE docker cleaning - no state persists from outside your scope

eventually we will fix the errors and then we will deploy again. in fixing the problems observe that the docker files in dist/ are generated by build scripts in the local repo. changes to the remote server will not be reflected in the local repo unless you also do them there.

kill system:

# 0) Stop everything (best-effort)
docker ps -q | xargs -r docker stop -t 0 || true

# 1) Force-remove all containers (handles stuck ones)
docker ps -aq | xargs -r docker rm -f || true

# 2) Prune builder cache (buildx) + classic builder cache (optional but safe)
docker buildx prune -af || true
docker builder prune -af || true

# 3) Remove ALL volumes (aggressive)
docker volume ls -q | xargs -r docker volume rm -f || true
docker volume prune -af || true

# 4) Remove unused networks (safe; images unaffected)
docker network prune -f || true

# 5) Prune system garbage WITHOUT touching images
# -f: no prompt
# (no -a, no --all, and no image prune)
docker system prune -f --volumes || true
