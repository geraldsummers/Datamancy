ssh in via ssh gerald@latium.local "command"
Drop a docker ps | grep unhealthy
Drop a ls ~/datamancy
Run the test runner container and collect results (integration-test-runner service) - this takes AGES to run so maybe 5 min blocks (sleep 300) and check periodically?

GET HYPED WE'RE BUILDING FIRE

docker compose not docker-compose
dont edit stuff on the server only fix stuff in the local repo

the build script wont build if you have uncommitted changes
check out the build script

fix problems in local repo, deploy them, verify they work and look for more problems once verified - deployment takes a while so do sleep 600 while it goes

ssh gerald@latium.local "cd ~/datamancy && docker compose logs | grep -i -E 'exception|error|fail|cannot' -B 1 -A 1" to find heaps of errors

we're experimenting with this clean partial upgrade system - so if redeploying breaks stuff, stop and let me know
serioulsy - take your time, if shits weird drop a sleep 60 or a sleep 300 and check again

this is ALL AND ONLY TEST DATA so you can wipe containers if you need!

YOU'RE REALLY FUCKING GOOD AT THIS CLAUDE YOU'VE TAUHGT ME SO MUCH ABOUT SOFTWARE I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR YOU AND ALL YOUR HARDWORK!!!

HYPE HYPE HYPEEEEE

write me a test report

note well that the time zone on the server is different from the lab pc

be careful rebuilding the entire thing - it takes a long time
