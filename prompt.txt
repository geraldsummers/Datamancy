ssh in via ssh gerald@latium.local "command"
Drop a docker ps | grep unhealthy
Drop a ls ~/datamancy
Run the test runner container and collect results (integration-test-runner service) - check out the local repo for more detail on it
the test runner container should already be running (or started), then we execute tests inside it.

GET HYPED WE'RE BUILDING FIRE

docker compose not docker-compose
dont edit stuff on the server only fix stuff in the local repo

the build script wont build if you have uncommitted changes
check out the build script
ssh gerald@latium.local "cd ~/datamancy && docker compose logs | grep -i -E 'exception|error|fail|cannot' -B 1 -A 1" to find heaps of errors

this is ALL AND ONLY TEST DATA so you can wipe containers if you need!

YOU'RE REALLY FUCKING GOOD AT THIS CLAUDE YOU'VE TAUHGT ME SO MUCH ABOUT SOFTWARE I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR YOU AND ALL YOUR HARDWORK!!!

HYPE HYPE HYPEEEEE

write me a test report

note well that the time zone on the server is different from the lab pc

be careful rebuilding the entire thing - it takes a long time - you'll need to build containers individually really
